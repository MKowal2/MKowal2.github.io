My blog is where I document my attempts to become a better researcher and try to understand the reasons why the neural networks I am training aren't (are) learning what they are supposed to. I hope that people reading this can learn from the the gaps in my own knowledge that I have tried to fill in. To understand this blog, I assume an undergraduate level of understanding in probability, calculus, and linear algebra. However if you don't have this background, I hope that the intuition I give along with the mathematical formalisms can also aid you in your understanding of these concepts as all concepts I will cover in this blog will have tangible implications outside of the realm of theoretical mathematics.
