### Do you work at a computer?

[In 2001, about 17% of Canadians worked at a computer daily](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/75-001-x/00501/5724-eng.html). Today in 2020, that number has only increased [CITE] as nearly every job requires some work at a computer. You go to work, you're on a computer. You take a break - you're on your computer (or phone) on Reddit, you go home and you watch some netflix... on a computer. The total time spent on electronic devices is monumental for the majority of people these days, and if you don't believe me, try recording your screen time on all of your devices and see how much time you *really* spend looking at screens. Before you ask why the heck I am bashing working computers when I myself am a computer scientist, let me be clear: computers are one of the most (if not the most) important tools of our time and the world is a better place because of them. However... That doesn't mean they don't come with their own set of potentially negative mental and physical issues that can arise from 'misuse'. I put quotation marks around 'misuse' because that word implies there is a 'correct' way to use a computer. The question I am answering in this blog post is: How can I use my computer more optimally? 

In my opinion, there are two ways to define how one uses a computer. There is the actual programs, algorithms, operating systems, websites, (etc...) that one uses on the computer (e.g., Facebook, Reddit, Python, PyTorch, Linux, etc.). But then there is the way you physically interact with the computer. This includes posture, screen brightness, time spent on a computer, etc. *Both* are important variables to your overall physical *and* mental health, but in this post I am going to focus on the later, i.e. how you can physically interact with the computer (as well as some stuff that is good for you in general).
