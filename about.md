My name is Matthew Kowal. I am a masters student at the [Ryerson Vision Lab](https://ryersonvisionlab.github.io/) in Toronto, co-supervised by [Dr. Neil Bruce](https://cs.ryerson.ca/~bruce/) and [Dr. Kosta Derpanis](https://cs.ryerson.ca/~kosta/). My research focuses on how we can better understand the world around us using neural networks and unlabelled data. In particular, I am currently working on action recognition with multi-modal and unsupervised data as well as semantic segmentation using weak supervision. I am also interested in how information theory can be used to better formulate traditional machine learning problems.
