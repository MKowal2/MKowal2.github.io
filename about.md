I completed a Bachelors of Applied Science (B.A.Sc) in [Applied Mathematics and Engineering](https://www.queensu.ca/mathstat/mthe) with a specialization in Mechanical Engineering at [Queen's University](https://www.queensu.ca/) in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. My [capstone project](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08914) was done on eye-tracking for the purpose of preventing driver inattention in automobiles. 

I worked for ~14 months (and the two summers between 2nd - 4th year as an intern) at [Morrison Hershfield](www.morrisonhershfield.com) after graduating as a mechanical design engineer (in training). I worked on a team with mechanical, evironmental, electrical, and control engineers on buildings, labratories, and condos. Some projects I worked on were: 1 Bloor East Condominium, Guelph Ontario Veterinarian College - Production Animal Isolation Facility, TTC McNicoll Bus Garage, and a University of Toronto Sandford Rooftop Physics Lab.

I then joined the [Ryerson Vision Lab](https://ryersonvisionlab.github.io/) in September 2018 as an MSc co-supervised by [Dr. Neil Bruce](https://cs.ryerson.ca/~bruce/) and [Dr. Kosta Derpanis](https://cs.ryerson.ca/~kosta/). My research has focused on action recognition and weakly supervised semantic segmentation. I am currently applying to PhD programs in the field of computer vision and 'explainable AI'.

My hobbies include health and fitness, competitive Super Smash Bros. Melee, tea, and progressive house music.
